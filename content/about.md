## Samuel Crane, PhD

I am the Director of Data Science at [Amplify](www.amplify.com), an educational technology company in Brooklyn. I lead a team of data scientists inside of Amplify's Research & Measurement group. Our focus is on analytics, algorithm development, and measuring the impact of our curricula and assessments.

Formerly a biologist, I earned my doctorate studying the ecology and evolutionary genetics of beetles before transitioning to a career in data science. My interests these days involve statistical programming, reproducible research, data visualization, team building, and product development. 

I live in lovely Brooklyn with my amazing wife, [Catherine](http://katiecovingtoncrane.com/), where we have a horrible tendency to buy more bottles of wine than can reasonably be stored in our little apartment. <i class='fas fa-wine-bottle'></i>
