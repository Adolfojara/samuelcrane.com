## Samuel Crane, PhD

I am the Director of Data Science at Amplify, an educational technology company in Brooklyn. I lead a team of data scientists inside of Amplify's Research & Measurement group. Our focus is on analytics, algorithm development, and measuring the impact of our curricula and assessments.

Formerly a biologist, I earned my doctorate studying the ecology and evolutionary genetics of beetles before transitioning to a career in data science. My focus these days is on statistical programming, reproducible research, data visualization, team building, and product development.
